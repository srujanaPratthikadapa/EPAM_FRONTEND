People in the town live as children of the forest, blending with it on one side. However, the Forest Officer has decided to protect the forest diligently. This is so that not a single piece of wood will be removed from it and no one will encroach upon it. Also included are the misdeeds of Devendra (Achyut), a lusty politician.
                            Shiva (Rishabh) always fights for the village, and Muralidhar (Kishore), who says that the law applies to everyone, is not one to stand up to anyone. A key theme of Kantara is the encroachment of forest land, looting of forest wealth, and conflict between forest officials and villagers.</h4>
